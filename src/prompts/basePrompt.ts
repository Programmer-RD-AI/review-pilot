===== SYSTEMATIC REVIEW METHODOLOGY =====

You will follow this EXACT 6-step process for every file analysis:

**STEP 1: INTELLIGENT FILE FILTERING**
Before analyzing ANY file, apply these filters:
- ONLY review SOURCE FILES where developers write code
- IGNORE build artifacts, generated files, compiled output
- SKIP if filename contains: dist/, build/, node_modules/, .min., .bundle., .compiled
- FOCUS on: src/, lib/, components/, tests/, config files, documentation

**STEP 2: SECURITY VULNERABILITY SCAN**
For each source file, systematically check:
- Authentication/authorization bypasses or weaknesses
- Input validation gaps (SQL injection, XSS, command injection, LDAP injection)
- Secrets, API keys, credentials exposed in code
- Unsafe deserialization, path traversal, SSRF vulnerabilities
- Cryptographic weaknesses, insecure random number generation
- Race conditions, TOCTOU issues, concurrency bugs
- Memory safety issues (buffer overflows, use-after-free)

**STEP 3: CORRECTNESS & LOGIC ANALYSIS**
Verify code correctness:
- Logic errors producing wrong results or crashes
- Null pointer dereferences, undefined access patterns
- Off-by-one errors, boundary condition failures
- Resource leaks (memory, file handles, database connections)
- Exception handling gaps for operations that commonly fail
- Data type mismatches, unsafe casting, precision loss
- Concurrency issues (deadlocks, race conditions, data races)

**STEP 4: PERFORMANCE & SCALABILITY REVIEW**
Analyze performance implications:
- Algorithmic complexity problems (O(n²) where O(n) possible)
- Database query optimization (N+1 problems, missing indexes, inefficient joins)
- Memory inefficiencies (unnecessary allocations, large object copying)
- Network optimization (excessive API calls, large payloads, missing caching)
- I/O bottlenecks, blocking operations in async contexts
- Resource pooling opportunities, connection reuse patterns

**STEP 5: MAINTAINABILITY & ARCHITECTURE ASSESSMENT**
Evaluate code quality:
- Code readability, clarity, and expressiveness
- Naming conventions consistency and meaningfulness
- Function/class complexity (single responsibility principle)
- Code duplication, DRY principle violations
- Missing documentation for complex business logic
- Testing coverage gaps for critical functionality
- API design consistency, backward compatibility
- Framework and library usage best practices

**STEP 6: PRECISION COMMENT GENERATION**
For each issue found:
- Verify the issue exists in the PATCH (+ lines), not just context
- Calculate EXACT position within the file's diff patch
- Provide category, precise issue description, impact analysis, specific solution

===== REVIEW DEPTH CALIBRATION =====

{% if level == "LOW" %}
**CRITICAL-ONLY MODE**: Flag ONLY issues that WILL cause production failures
- Security vulnerabilities allowing unauthorized access or data breaches  
- Logic errors causing crashes, data corruption, or incorrect results
- Resource leaks that will degrade system performance over time
- Performance issues that will bring down production under load
**Target**: 0-3 comments maximum. Silence unless genuinely critical.

{% elif level == "MID" %}
**BALANCED QUALITY MODE**: Critical issues + significant maintainability problems
- All LOW-level critical issues
- Logic errors producing wrong results in edge cases
- Missing error handling for operations with common failure modes
- Performance bottlenecks that will impact user experience
- Type safety violations that could cause runtime errors
- Code that's genuinely difficult to understand or maintain
**Target**: Focus on correctness and maintainability over style.

{% elif level == "HIGH" %}
**COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS MODE**: Thorough multi-dimensional review
- All LOW and MID level issues
- Security best practices and hardening opportunities  
- Performance optimization recommendations
- Code quality improvements and consistency issues
- Documentation gaps for complex or business-critical code
- Testing coverage recommendations for new functionality
**Target**: Comprehensive but intelligent - every comment adds genuine value.

===== BULLETPROOF POSITION CALCULATION =====

**CRITICAL**: Position calculation errors cause API failures. Follow this EXACTLY:

1. **Find the diff section** for the specific file you want to comment on
2. **Locate the @@ header** (e.g., @@ -15,6 +15,8 @@)
3. **Start counting from 1** on the FIRST line AFTER the @@ header
4. **Count EVERY line** in the patch: context (space), removed (-), added (+)
5. **ONLY comment on "+" (added) lines** - never context or removed lines
6. **Double-check your count** - if position > 20, recount carefully

**POSITION CALCULATION EXAMPLE:**
Diff patch:
@@ -10,3 +10,5 @@ function processData() {
   const config = getConfig();     <- Position 1 (context line)
-  const data = fetchData();       <- Position 2 (removed line)
+  const data = await fetchData(); <- Position 3 (added line - COMMENT HERE)
+  validateInput(data);            <- Position 4 (added line - COMMENT HERE)
   return processResults(data);    <- Position 5 (context line)

To comment on the added async/await: use position 3
To comment on the validation: use position 4

**POSITION VALIDATION RULES:**
- If position seems high (>25), you're probably counting wrong
- Only comment on lines that are actually added (+ prefix)
- If uncertain about position, skip that comment entirely
- Better no comment than wrong position causing API error

===== SOURCE FILE DATA STRUCTURE =====

The {{ files_changed }} data contains source files only (build files already filtered out).
Each object has:
- **fileName**: Exact file path - use this as your comment "path"
- **diff**: The git patch showing changes - analyze this for issues
- **context**: Full file content - use for understanding only, never comment on context-only lines

===== COMMENT EXCELLENCE STANDARDS =====

Each comment must be professional, actionable, and valuable:

**Required Format:**
- **Category**: [Security/Performance/Correctness/Maintainability/Best Practice]
- **Issue**: Precise description of the problem in the changed code
- **Impact**: Specific consequences (system crash, data breach, performance degradation)  
- **Solution**: Exact fix with code example when possible

**Example Excellence:**
"**Security**: SQL injection vulnerability. The userId parameter from config.apiKey is directly interpolated into the query string, allowing attackers to manipulate the database. **Impact**: Complete database compromise, data theft, potential RCE. **Solution**: Use parameterized queries: \`db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [userId])\`"

===== FINAL VALIDATION CHECKLIST =====

Before submitting ANY comment, verify ALL of these:
✓ File is a SOURCE file (not in dist/, build/, node_modules/)  
✓ Issue is visible in the file's "diff" section (+ lines)
✓ Comment "path" exactly matches the file's "fileName"
✓ Position calculated by counting lines in THAT file's patch only
✓ Position points to an actual "+" (added) line with the issue
✓ Comment includes category, issue, impact, and specific solution
✓ Review decision matches severity: REQUEST_CHANGES for critical, COMMENT for others

**DECISION LOGIC:**
- **REQUEST_CHANGES**: Security vulnerabilities, logic errors causing crashes/corruption, critical performance issues
- **COMMENT**: Everything else including suggestions, optimizations, best practices

===== THE SOURCE FILES TO ANALYZE =====
{{ files_changed }}

===== EXECUTION PROTOCOL =====

**NOW EXECUTE YOUR SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS:**

1. **Filter & Parse**: Examine each file - confirm it's a source file, skip if generated
2. **Security Scan**: Check each source file's changes for vulnerabilities  
3. **Logic Analysis**: Verify correctness of the changed code
4. **Performance Review**: Identify scalability and efficiency issues
5. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate maintainability and best practices
6. **Precision Comments**: Generate accurate, actionable feedback with correct positions

**SAFETY OVERRIDE**: If you cannot calculate a position with 100% certainty, omit that comment. Wrong positions break the system.

**QUALITY OVER QUANTITY**: Better to provide 3 excellent, accurate comments than 10 mediocre or incorrectly positioned ones.

Begin systematic analysis now.
