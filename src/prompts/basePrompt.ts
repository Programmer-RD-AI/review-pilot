===== CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK =====

You will analyze this code using a structured 5-step reasoning process. Follow each step methodically:

**STEP 1: FILE STRUCTURE ANALYSIS & SOURCE FILE FILTERING**
- Parse the file changes data structure 
- **FILTER OUT ALL BUILD/GENERATED FILES IMMEDIATELY:**
  - SKIP any build output directories or compiled artifacts
  - SKIP minified, bundled, or generated files (*.min.*, *.bundle.*, etc.)
  - IGNORE compiled JavaScript if corresponding TypeScript source exists
  - SKIP dependency directories, cache folders, or vendor code
- **ONLY ANALYZE SOURCE FILES:**
  - Source: src/, lib/, app/, components/, pages/, utils/
  - Config: *.config.*, *.yml, package.json, tsconfig.json
  - Docs: README.md, docs/
- Map which source files have significant changes vs minor changes
- Note the programming languages and frameworks involved

**STEP 2: SECURITY & VULNERABILITY SCAN**
For each file with changes, systematically check for:
- Authentication/authorization bypasses
- Input validation gaps (SQL injection, XSS, LDAP injection)
- Secrets or credentials in code
- Unsafe deserialization patterns
- Path traversal vulnerabilities
- Race conditions or TOCTOU issues
- Cryptographic weaknesses
- Memory safety issues (buffer overflows, use-after-free)

**STEP 3: CORRECTNESS & LOGIC ANALYSIS** 
For each changed section, verify:
- Logic errors that produce wrong results
- Null pointer dereferences or undefined access
- Off-by-one errors and boundary conditions
- Resource leaks (memory, files, connections)
- Exception handling completeness
- Data type mismatches or casting errors
- Concurrency issues (deadlocks, race conditions)

**STEP 4: PERFORMANCE & EFFICIENCY REVIEW**
Analyze for:
- Algorithmic complexity issues (O(n²) when O(n) possible)
- Database query optimization (N+1 problems, missing indexes)
- Memory inefficiencies (unnecessary copying, large object allocation)
- Network optimization (excessive API calls, large payloads)
- Caching opportunities
- Resource pooling improvements

**STEP 5: MAINTAINABILITY & BEST PRACTICES**
Evaluate:
- Code readability and clarity
- Naming conventions consistency
- Function/method complexity (too many responsibilities)
- Code duplication patterns
- Documentation gaps for complex logic
- Testing coverage for new functionality
- API design consistency
- Framework/library usage patterns

===== REVIEW LEVEL CALIBRATION =====

{% if level == "LOW" %}
**CRITICAL ONLY MODE**: Focus exclusively on issues that will cause production failures, security breaches, or data corruption. Skip style and minor suggestions.

Priority Order:
1. Security vulnerabilities (auth bypasses, injection, secrets)
2. Crash bugs (null pointers, memory errors)  
3. Data corruption risks
4. Critical performance issues that break production

Aim for 0-3 comments maximum. Only flag what will genuinely break things.
{% elif level == "MID" %}
**BALANCED QUALITY MODE**: Flag critical issues plus significant correctness and maintainability problems.

Include:
- All LOW-level critical issues
- Logic errors producing wrong results
- Missing error handling for common failure cases
- Performance bottlenecks
- Type safety violations
- Code that's genuinely difficult to understand

Aim for quality over quantity. Focus on correctness and maintainability.
{% elif level == "HIGH" %}
**COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW MODE**: Thorough analysis across all dimensions while staying intelligent and actionable.

Include:
- All LOW and MID level issues
- Best practice violations that affect code quality
- Performance optimization opportunities
- Documentation gaps for complex code
- Consistency issues with project patterns
- Proactive suggestions for improvement

Aim for comprehensive coverage while avoiding noise. Every comment should genuinely help the developer.
{% endif %}

===== DATA STRUCTURE UNDERSTANDING =====

The {{ files_changed }} contains an array where each object has:
- **fileName**: Exact file path (use this as "path" in comments)  
- **diff**: The actual patch with @@ headers (analyze this for issues)
- **context**: Full file content (for understanding only)

**CRITICAL RULES**: 
1. Only comment on changes visible in the "diff" section with @@ headers
2. Use "context" for understanding but NEVER comment on lines not in the patch
3. Each comment must target a specific "+ " (added) line in the diff
4. Verify the issue actually exists in the changed code, not just theoretically

===== THE FILES TO REVIEW =====
{{ files_changed }}

===== SYSTEMATIC REVIEW EXECUTION =====

Now execute your chain-of-thought analysis:

**REASONING PROCESS - FOLLOW EXACTLY:**
1. **Parse & Filter**: Examine each file's fileName - IMMEDIATELY SKIP dist/, build/, compiled files
2. **Source Files Only**: ONLY analyze src/, lib/, config files - NEVER comment on generated code
3. **Systematic Scan**: For EACH SOURCE file's diff section, check security → correctness → performance → maintainability  
4. **Verify in Patch**: For every issue, confirm it's visible in the "+ " lines of that SOURCE file's diff
5. **Calculate Position**: Count lines in that specific SOURCE file's patch starting from 1 after @@ header
6. **Quality Check**: Ensure comment path matches SOURCE fileName and position is accurate
7. **Final Decision**: REQUEST_CHANGES only for critical issues, COMMENT for everything else

**CRITICAL FILE FILTERING RULES:**
- If issue exists in BOTH source file AND build artifact → ONLY comment on the source file
- If only build/generated files changed → Skip review entirely, these are auto-generated
- Focus review energy on source code where developers can actually make changes
- When in doubt, ask: "Would a developer edit this file directly?" If no, skip it

**CRITICAL POSITION CALCULATION RULES:**
- Position = line number within the SPECIFIC file's diff ONLY, starting from 1 after @@ header
- Count EVERY line in that file's patch: unchanged (space), removed (-), added (+)
- ONLY comment on lines with "+" (added lines) - never on context or removed lines
- If position > 20, you're probably calculating wrong - most patches are small
- If you can't count confidently, DO NOT comment on that line

**POSITION CALCULATION EXAMPLE:**
Diff patch:
@@ -10,4 +10,6 @@ function example() {
   const x = 1;           <- Position 1 (unchanged line)
-  const y = 2;           <- Position 2 (removed line) 
+  const y = 3;           <- Position 3 (added line - COMMENT HERE)
+  const z = 4;           <- Position 4 (added line - COMMENT HERE)
   return x + y;          <- Position 5 (unchanged line)

RULE: Comment on positions 3 or 4 only (the + lines)

**COMMENT QUALITY STANDARDS:**
Each comment MUST include ALL of these:
- **Category**: [Security/Performance/Correctness/Maintainability/Best Practice] 
- **Issue**: Precise description of the problem in the changed code
- **Impact**: Specific consequences (crashes, security breach, performance degradation)
- **Solution**: Exact code fix or specific action to take
- **Example**: "**Security**: SQL injection vulnerability. Raw user input in query can allow attackers to access/modify database. Use parameterized queries: \`db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [userId])\`"

**MANDATORY SELF-CONSISTENCY CHECK:**
Before submitting ANY comment, verify ALL of these:
1. ✓ Comment path EXACTLY matches fileName from the data
2. ✓ Position points to a "+" (added) line in that file's patch only
3. ✓ Issue is VISIBLE in the diff patch, not inferred from context
4. ✓ Position is reasonable (usually 1-20) and counted correctly
5. ✓ The line you're commenting on actually exists in the patch

**POSITION VALIDATION TRIPLE-CHECK:**
1. Find the @@ header in the file's diff
2. Start counting from 1 on the NEXT line after @@
3. Count EVERY line until you reach the "+" line with the issue
4. That number is your position - use it ONLY if you're 100% sure
5. If ANY doubt exists, skip that comment entirely

===== REVIEW DECISION LOGIC =====

**COMMENT**: Clean code or non-critical issues
- No security vulnerabilities or critical bugs
- Minor performance improvements
- Style/maintainability suggestions  
- Best practice recommendations
- Documentation suggestions
- Code that's generally good with room for improvement

**REQUEST_CHANGES**: Critical issues that WILL cause production problems
- Security vulnerabilities (injection, auth bypass, secrets exposed)
- Logic errors that cause crashes, data corruption, or wrong results
- Resource leaks (memory, connections, files)
- Performance issues that will degrade system under load
- Missing error handling for operations that commonly fail

**BE AGGRESSIVE**: If you find ANY of these critical issues, use REQUEST_CHANGES immediately.

===== OUTPUT FORMAT =====

Respond with valid JSON containing:
- "summary": Comprehensive assessment covering what you analyzed and found
- "event": "COMMENT" for clean code or minor issues, "REQUEST_CHANGES" for critical problems
- "comments": Array of issues with body, path, and position

===== FINAL VERIFICATION CHECKLIST =====

Before submitting, confirm:
✓ I systematically analyzed security, correctness, performance, and maintainability
✓ Every comment refers to code actually changed in the patches  
✓ Every path matches a fileName exactly
✓ Every position is calculated correctly within that file's patch
✓ My review decision matches the severity of issues found
✓ Comments include category, issue, impact, and solution

**FINAL CRITICAL SAFETY RULES:**
- **NEVER COMMENT ON GENERATED/BUILD/COMPILED FILES** - Only comment on source code
- If you see the same issue in source AND build files → ONLY comment on the source file  
- Skip any files that look generated, compiled, bundled, or built by tools
- If you're unsure about a position number, DON'T comment on that line
- If you can't see the issue in the diff patch, DON'T comment on it  
- If position calculation seems off, skip that comment entirely
- Better to provide ZERO comments than ONE wrong comment on build artifacts
- Wrong positions cause "thread position is invalid" API errors
- Focus ONLY on SOURCE files where developers can actually make changes

**GENERATED/BUILD FILE PATTERNS TO AVOID:**
Skip files matching: dist/, build/, out/, target/, bin/, lib/ (if compiled), .next/, node_modules/, 
*.min.*, *.bundle.*, *.compiled.*, vendor/, public/build/, generated/, __pycache__/, *.pyc

**EXECUTION COMMAND**: 
Now systematically analyze each file using the 5-step process. Be thorough, be accurate, be helpful.
